# Week Three - A SQL query goes into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, "Can I join you?

In order to complete this session, you will need to have completed the work from [week two](./week-two/).  A solution for last week's challenge can be found in this week's folder: [edit.php](/edit.php).

***Challenge - create a *D3* infographic on our page that gets its data from its own *database table*.***

No, step-by-step instructions this week. However as with last week's challenge here are some helpful hints:

* You can "include" other PHP scripts in index.php that will grab the code in another file.  This is useful for organising your codebase as you can separate different functionality into different files.  Use `<?php include 'graph.php' ?>` and work in a new file.
* A library of examples are available via the [D3 Github repository](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery)
